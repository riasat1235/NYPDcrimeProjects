In this project, the crime data from New York Police Department(NYPD) will be analyzed. The dataset includes all 
valid felony, misdemeanor and violation crimes reported to NYPD. Here, some correlations in crime factors will be 
found to make effective crime prediction to improve the efficiency of the police officer. Pyhton API of Spark (pyspark)
will be used in this project with some packages like SparkML, SparkSQL dataframe.
